[EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 23:53, sleepConfidence indicates high sleep (sleepConfidence=95%), but activity state reports an active state ('walking') near the same time.\n - Related events: 2\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4.
