[EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 09:02, the presence signal indicates the user is away (not_home), yet 10 motion-active events occur within the next 30 minutes.\n - Related events: 9\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4.
