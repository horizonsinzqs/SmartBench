[EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 17:32, sleepConfidence indicates high sleep (sleepConfidence=95%), yet 11 motion-active events occur within a 10-minute window.\n - Related events: 9\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4.
