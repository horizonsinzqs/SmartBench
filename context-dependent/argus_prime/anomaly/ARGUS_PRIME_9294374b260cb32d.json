  "reasoning": "1. [LABEL]\n Label: anomaly\n Subtype: user_state - away_but_motion\n Time period: afternoon, Season: spring\n\n2. [EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 15:29, the presence signal indicates the user is away (not_home), yet 16 motion-active events occur within the next 30 minutes.\n - Related events: 9\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4.
