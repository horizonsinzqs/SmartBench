  "reasoning": "1. [LABEL]\n Label: anomaly\n Subtype: user_state - activity_sleep_conflict\n Time period: afternoon, Season: autumn\n\n2. [EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 14:15, sleepConfidence indicates high sleep (sleepConfidence=95%), but activity state reports an active state ('walking') near the same time.\n - Related events: 2\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4.
