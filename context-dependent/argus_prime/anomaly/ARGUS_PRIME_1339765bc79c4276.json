  "description": "In the morning of a autumn weekend. the smart home system recorded 20 sensor events from 8 devices over 2 hours. Key activities include: door/window state changes, lighting control. A total of 11 device state transitions occurred.",
  "reasoning": "1. [LABEL]\n Label: anomaly\n Subtype: user_state - activity_sleep_conflict\n Time period: morning, Season: autumn\n\n2. [EVIDENCE]\n Evidence 1: At 07:20, sleepConfidence indicates high sleep (sleepConfidence=95%), but activity state reports an active state ('walking') near the same time.\n - Related events: 2\n - Confidence: 90%\n\n3. [SCOPE NOTE]\n - This reasoning is based only on the provided IoT event trace and the evidence above.\n - It does not attribute intent or root causes beyond what is observable in the events.\n\n4. [CONFIDENCE]\n Confidence: 90%",
