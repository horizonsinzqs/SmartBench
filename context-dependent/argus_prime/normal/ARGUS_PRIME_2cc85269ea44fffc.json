  "description": "During morning on a summer weekday. the system monitored 60 events across 7 devices within 45 minutes. Key activities include: motion detection, door/window state changes. A total of 53 device state transitions occurred.",
  "reasoning": "1. [OBSERVATIONS]\n - Time period: morning, Season: summer\n - Duration: 44.9 minutes\n - Devices involved: 7\n - Total events: 60\n\n2. [ANALYSIS]\n Device activity distribution:\n - co2: 8 events\n - sound: 21 events\n - sleep: 1 events\n - door: 4 events\n - motion: 26 events\n State transitions: 53\n\n3. [EVIDENCE EVALUATION]\n Evidence 1: CO2 readings show a noticeable rising trend (can look suspicious in isolation).\n - Confidence: 72%\n Evidence 2: CO2 increases are common during meal-time/home activity and should be judged with temporal trends.\n - Confidence: 82%\n\n4. [EXCLUSION ANALYSIS]\n - Physical consistency check: PASSED\n - Causal reasonableness check: PASSED\n - Temporal coherence check: PASSED\n\n5. [CONCLUSION]\n Confidence: 90%\n Basis: All activity patterns are consistent with typical smart home usage",
