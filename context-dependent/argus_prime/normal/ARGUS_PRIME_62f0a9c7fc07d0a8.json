  "description": "During night on a summer weekday. the smart home system recorded 60 sensor events from 6 devices over 2 hours. Key activities include: motion detection, door/window state changes. A total of 53 device state transitions occurred.",
  "reasoning": "1. [OBSERVATIONS]\n - Time period: night, Season: summer\n - Duration: 119.6 minutes\n - Devices involved: 6\n - Total events: 60\n\n2. [ANALYSIS]\n Device activity distribution:\n - motion: 40 events\n - sleep: 15 events\n - presence: 1 events\n - window: 1 events\n - door: 2 events\n State transitions: 53\n\n3. [EVIDENCE EVALUATION]\n Evidence 1: Frequent motion detections are recorded during a late-night period (can look suspicious in a snapshot).\n - Confidence: 80%\n Evidence 2: SleepConfidence is only 11%, suggesting the user is awake (normal late-night activity).\n - Confidence: 85%\n\n4. [EXCLUSION ANALYSIS]\n - Physical consistency check: PASSED\n - Causal reasonableness check: PASSED\n - Temporal coherence check: PASSED\n\n5. [CONCLUSION]\n Confidence: 90%\n Basis: All activity patterns are consistent with typical smart home usage",
