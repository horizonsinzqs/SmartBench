Evidence: living_room_temp_sensor (living_room): 25 events; range 23.0C→85.0C (min @ 2026-09-03T03:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T14:23:45); last 26.0C @ 2026-09-03T23:00:00 | living_room_temp_sensor (living_room): 25 events; range 23.0C→85.0C (min @ 2026-09-03T03:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T14:23:45); last 26.0C @ 2026-09-03T23:00:00 | basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 43.4%→95.0% (min @ 2026-09-03T00:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T12:00:00); last 93.3% @ 2026-09-03T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→1840.0ppm (min @ 2026-09-03T20:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T07:00:00); last 998ppm @ 2026-09-03T23:00:00 Interpretation: several device streams exhibit trajectories or state patterns that deviate from what the configured routine and cross-device dependencies would typically produce. Potential impact: sustained misbehavior in environmental control, security, or power management can reduce comfort, increase energy use, or create safety risks.",
