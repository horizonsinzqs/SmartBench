Evidence: bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 169 events; range 400.0ppm→1881.0ppm (min @ 2026-01-06T18:00:00, max @ 2025-12-03T06:00:00); last 998ppm @ 2026-01-12T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 169 events; range 400.0ppm→1881.0ppm (min @ 2026-01-06T18:00:00, max @ 2025-12-03T06:00:00); last 998ppm @ 2026-01-12T23:00:00 | basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 168 events; range 24.5%→48.8% (min @ 2025-12-06T07:00:00, max @ 2025-12-05T18:00:00); last 37.4% @ 2026-01-12T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 168 events; range 14.9C→26.3C (min @ 2025-12-03T17:00:00, max @ 2025-12-04T13:00:00); last 19.9C @ 2026-01-12T23:00:00 Interpretation: several device streams exhibit trajectories or state patterns that deviate from what the configured routine and cross-device dependencies would typically produce. Potential impact: sustained misbehavior in environmental control, security, or power management can reduce comfort, increase energy use, or create safety risks.",
