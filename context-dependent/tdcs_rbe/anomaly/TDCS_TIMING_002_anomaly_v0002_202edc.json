  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-01-10T00:00:00 to 2026-01-10T23:00:00 (1 day(s)); context: season=Winter, weather=Sunny, occupancy=single_adult_office_worker; total_events=241; top_rooms=bedroom,basement. Evidence: living_room_light (living_room): 2 events; first ON @ 2026-01-10T20:30:05; last OFF @ 2026-01-10T21:00:00 | living_room_switch (living_room): 1 events; first COMMAND @ 2026-01-10T20:30:00; last COMMAND @ 2026-01-10T20:30:00 | basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 26.4%→47.9% (min @ 2026-01-10T07:00:00, max @ 2026-01-10T18:00:00); last 41.5% @ 2026-01-10T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→1828.0ppm (min @ 2026-01-10T20:00:00, max @ 2026-01-10T06:00:00); last 1002ppm @ 2026-01-10T23:00:00 Interpretation: living_room_switch reports state updates and living_room_light reports states, but the two streams are weakly coupled in time, suggesting a control/automation mismatch or actuator malfunction. Potential impact: sustained misbehavior in environmental control, security, or power management can reduce comfort, increase energy use, or create safety risks.",
