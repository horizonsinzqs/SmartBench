  "description": "Counterfactual paired sample of TDCS_CAUSAL_013 (same routine without injected faults)",
  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-02-10T00:00:00 to 2026-02-10T23:00:00 (1 day(s)); context: season=Winter, weather=Cold, occupancy=single_adult_office_worker; total_events=245; top_rooms=bedroom,basement. Evidence: basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 15.2%→43.2% (min @ 2026-02-10T22:00:00, max @ 2026-02-10T00:00:00); last 18.6% @ 2026-02-10T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→1828.0ppm (min @ 2026-02-10T18:00:00, max @ 2026-02-10T06:00:00); last 998ppm @ 2026-02-10T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 13.9C→20.4C (min @ 2026-02-10T14:00:00, max @ 2026-02-10T19:00:00); last 20.0C @ 2026-02-10T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
