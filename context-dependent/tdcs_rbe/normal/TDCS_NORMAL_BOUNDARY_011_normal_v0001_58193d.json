  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-09-03T00:00:00 to 2026-09-16T23:00:00 (14 day(s)); context: season=Summer, weather=Sunny, occupancy=family; total_events=3116; top_rooms=bedroom,basement. Evidence: Context markers: calendar_event:NEWBORN_CARE_PERIOD @ 2026-09-03T00:00:00; home_profile:NEWBORN:TRUE @ 2026-09-03T00:00:00 | basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 336 events; range 43.9%→95.0% (min @ 2026-09-03T00:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T12:00:00); last 95.0% @ 2026-09-16T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 336 events; range 400.0ppm→409.0ppm (min @ 2026-09-03T00:00:00, max @ 2026-09-03T07:00:00); last 400ppm @ 2026-09-16T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 336 events; range 22.7C→25.1C (min @ 2026-09-03T03:00:00, max @ 2025-12-02T12:00:00); last 24.3C @ 2026-09-16T23:00:00 Interpretation: explicit mode/profile/calendar markers in the event stream explain atypical timing or occupancy patterns without requiring a fault hypothesis. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
