  "description": "Counterfactual paired sample of TDCS_LEAK_005 (same routine without injected faults)",
  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-04-10T00:00:00 to 2026-04-16T23:00:00 (7 day(s)); context: season=Spring, weather=Sunny, occupancy=single_adult_office_worker; total_events=1264; top_rooms=bathroom,kitchen. Evidence: bathroom_humidity_sensor (bathroom): 168 events; range 20.7%→50.8% (min @ 2025-12-02T04:00:00, max @ 2026-04-10T00:00:00); last 39.8% @ 2026-04-16T23:00:00 | bathroom_temp_sensor (bathroom): 168 events; range 18.7C→27.0C (min @ 2025-12-02T09:00:00, max @ 2025-12-03T15:00:00); last 22.5C @ 2026-04-16T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 168 events; range 19.0C→29.2C (min @ 2026-04-10T01:00:00, max @ 2026-04-10T14:00:00); last 19.4C @ 2026-04-16T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
