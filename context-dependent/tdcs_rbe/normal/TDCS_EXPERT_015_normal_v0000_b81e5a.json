  "description": "Counterfactual paired sample of TDCS_EXPERT_015 (same routine without injected faults)",
  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-03-10T00:00:00 to 2026-03-10T23:00:00 (1 day(s)); context: season=Winter, weather=Sunny, occupancy=weekday_worker; total_events=179; top_rooms=basement,bedroom. Evidence: basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 26.4%→46.2% (min @ 2026-03-10T08:00:00, max @ 2026-03-10T00:00:00); last 39.4% @ 2026-03-10T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→1823.0ppm (min @ 2026-03-10T19:00:00, max @ 2026-03-10T06:00:00); last 1007ppm @ 2026-03-10T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 15.1C→26.1C (min @ 2026-03-10T17:00:00, max @ 2026-03-10T13:00:00); last 20.0C @ 2026-03-10T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
