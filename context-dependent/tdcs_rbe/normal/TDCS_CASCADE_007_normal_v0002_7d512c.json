  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-09-07T00:00:00 to 2026-09-07T23:00:00 (1 day(s)); context: season=Summer, weather=Heatwave, occupancy=family_with_kids; total_events=243; top_rooms=bedroom,basement. Evidence: basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 44.3%→95.0% (min @ 2026-09-07T00:00:00, max @ 2026-09-07T14:00:00); last 93.1% @ 2026-09-07T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→1820.0ppm (min @ 2026-09-07T18:00:00, max @ 2026-09-07T06:00:00); last 1206ppm @ 2026-09-07T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 23.5C→28.4C (min @ 2026-09-07T22:00:00, max @ 2026-09-07T09:00:00); last 24.2C @ 2026-09-07T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
