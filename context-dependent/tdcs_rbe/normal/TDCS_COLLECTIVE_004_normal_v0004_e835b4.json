  "description": "Counterfactual paired sample of TDCS_COLLECTIVE_004 (same routine without injected faults)",
  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-06-06T00:00:00 to 2026-06-06T23:00:00 (1 day(s)); context: season=Spring, weather=Sunny, occupancy=family_on_vacation; total_events=143; top_rooms=bedroom,basement. Evidence: basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 24 events; range 39.2%→48.0% (min @ 2026-06-06T03:00:00, max @ 2026-06-06T14:00:00); last 45.2% @ 2026-06-06T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 400.0ppm→408.0ppm (min @ 2026-06-06T00:00:00, max @ 2026-06-06T01:00:00); last 408ppm @ 2026-06-06T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 24 events; range 14.2C→29.2C (min @ 2026-06-06T02:00:00, max @ 2026-06-06T14:00:00); last 14.4C @ 2026-06-06T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
