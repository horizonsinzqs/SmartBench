  "description": "Counterfactual paired sample of TDCS_EXPERT_004 (same routine without injected faults)",
  "reasoning": "Observation window: 2026-06-27T00:00:00 to 2026-07-24T23:00:00 (28 day(s)); context: season=Summer, weather=Cloudy, occupancy=single_adult_working; total_events=4946; top_rooms=basement,bedroom. Evidence: basement_humidity_sensor (basement): 672 events; range 45.4%→95.0% (min @ 2026-06-27T00:00:00, max @ 2026-06-27T13:00:00); last 95.0% @ 2026-07-24T23:00:00 | bedroom_co2_sensor (bedroom): 672 events; range 400.0ppm→1882.0ppm (min @ 2026-06-27T20:00:00, max @ 2025-12-16T06:00:00); last 998ppm @ 2026-07-24T23:00:00 | bedroom_temp_sensor (bedroom): 672 events; range 23.3C→29.1C (min @ 2025-12-07T19:00:00, max @ 2025-12-11T09:00:00); last 23.6C @ 2026-07-24T23:00:00 Interpretation: device transitions and sensor trajectories form a coherent household routine without contradictions in timing, room-device mapping, or physical ranges. Benign exclusion: short-lived sensor noise and sparse reporting can create edge-looking readings, but the overall multi-device pattern remains self-consistent.",
